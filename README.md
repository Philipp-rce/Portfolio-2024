## Important

My portfolio is not built 100% by me, the groundwork is by "YouTube/Codehal"

A friend helped me with some of the technology choices, design changes and most of the typescript code.
Most of the code is written by me, but without the help of the people mentioned above, this portfolio would not exist.
